The huge criticism is propounded on the doctrine of ‘secularism’ and demands the termination of such practices in its entirety. At the same time, some countries have also played a significant role in limiting the right to freedom of religious and culture expression by imposing laws concerning only the state authorities. Both secular as well as theocratic states have thus played a role in the amplification of religious as well as cultural intolerance amongst the masses.</p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Often, we stumble upon a news article stating the restriction of specific symbol or clothing due to profound religious discrimination that exists worldwide. Or in other cases (such as the Middle East countries), we discover religious dress codes being enforced on women against their will, for such theocratic states use ‘religion’ as a means to campaign for the ‘immortal’ patriarchy. Women are often told what to wear and what not to, either by their own family members or the people around them. The most disheartening thing to see in today’s time is that the very fundamental laws that were made to protect human rights now mandate people to wear clothes or symbols according to one’s country belief or ideologies. Why is there a constant need to make people wear things against their own form of self-expression? Even the most secular states (in ‘written constitution’) resort to restricting people’s Right to clothing. The recent ban of headscarves worn by Muslim women as a form of their religious expression in France speaks volumes of the increasing demolition of the Right to freedom of expression. Hence, this paper attempts to discuss the impact of such laws restricting people’s Right to expression of religion and culture in society through country-specific case studies and tries to find a pragmatic solution to the problem.</p> <p>Many laws drafted by states also reflect upon the suppression of one gender, restricting them in their prescribed gender norms. As in most cases, it is woman’s clothing that is questioned by society at large. Theocratic states consisting of one state religion, such as Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, incorporate different, harsh punishments for the women (who are the so-called divine symbols of a country’s religious stature) in case they fail to abide by the religion-based laws (Doumato). Such practices contribute towards grave human rights violations in the hands of several country- specific legislations around the globe. And hence in order to safeguard the rights and will of citizens at large, such laws call for speculation in view of the international treaties and conventions.</p> <p>While there has been research conducted on the violation of the Right to religious freedom of expression with the proposition of laws, we attempt to analyse the laws of different political systems and their sociological impact on its citizens. Focussing on the different models of approach, the discourse of the paper will try to deduce the best model that should be followed.</p> <h2>I. Countries whose legal system is enshrined with the doctrine of 'secularism'</h2> <h3>A. Secular State: France</h3> <p>Over the years, various countries have enshrined different legal systems in accordance with varied socio-religious dynamics. Similarly, in France, there exists a separation between state authority and religion. The French Constitution encourages the principle of laïcité, wherein the French state and government avoid taking a stance on matters of religious significance and maintains neutrality towards the religious beliefs of the masses (Mohanty 46). Adding to this pretext, people are required to keep their personal and public life separate as two different dimensions wherein one’s religious form of expression should not come in light of the public sphere. Although such principles were formulated in order to keep uniformity and equality amongst its citizen, it fails to account for the various international documents that cherish the foundational principles of secularism and modernity (which mostly all European countries are signatories of) (Črnič 113). Such conventions and declarations promote the persistence of humanity and tolerance amongst the global citizens. And thus, the signatories ought to respect such provisions and incorporate the same within their national boundaries. While in reality, many countries construct their own interpretations to suit their country’s own narrative and belief.</p> <p>In practical terms, it is evident to notice that most religions are not concerned with one practising one’s religious beliefs according to any preferred surroundings. Religious codes strive to regulate a person’s entire life and hence do not differentiate between public and private lives (Mohanty 46). If any religion requires one to wear a religious attire or symbol, it is to be carried in both public and private spheres. Thus, it is inherently impossible for a person to profess their faith with complete freedom in a country like France (where one is forbidden to express their faith in public). It implies that a “secular” country such as France does not uphold the basic fundamental rights as they find their roots deeply embedded in the laïcité principle. Moreover, France guarantees equality of all irrespective of one’s religion, and at the same time, refuses to include religion as a matter of the state. Such a provision is extremely problematic when it comes to safeguarding or protecting one’s individual rights, and at the same time demolishes the essence of the same ‘secularism’ that the state vowed to stand for.</p> <p>In 2004, the French government passed a law banning “conspicuous religious symbols’ such as the Muslim headscarf, Sikh turban and the Jewish skullcap. Furthermore, in 2010, a law was passed forbidding Muslim women to conceal their faces in public, robbing them of their Right to freedom of religious expression. Similarly, in 2021, the French Senate’s move to ban the hijab for girls under the age of 18 in the public sphere led to widespread criticism and massive protests worldwide (#HandsoffMyHijab). While it has not been passed yet, it showcases that such laws formulated in the name of “French secularism” deprive people of the root essence of the principle of ‘secularism’ where all individuals are guaranteed the freedom of religion to practice and profess in whichever way that suits them. Amnesty International stated that this proposed ban of headscarves poses a “serious attack on rights and freedom in France” and demanded the scrapping of “many problematic provisions” (Aljazeera). Moreover, such propositions in the court of law prevent the states from formulating social reforms for religious minorities residing in the country. While it is noteworthy that religious minorities are subjected to atrocities committed in the name of ‘intolerance’, the state by virtue of its neutral stand in matters of religious significance would then do nothing to cherish and protect its people (minorities).</p> <h3>B. Secular State: South Africa</h3> <p>Like many other countries such as New Zealand, Canada, South Africa is known to respect religious and cultural diversity, and the Constitution itself safeguards the people’s Right to the Expression of Religion in both public and private spheres. The makers of the constitution for the state of South Africa have inherently made sure to respect the diversified needs and whims of the citizens. Owing to its vehemently prolonged period of attaining Independence (getting rid of the elitist white superiority), this particular nation has efficiently provided legislations so as to protect the sentiments of the plethora of races and religious beliefs which continue to strive on its motherland. People are free to profess their religions respectfully without the constant fear of being subjected to grave punishments by the state authorities itself.</p> <p><strong><em>Constitutional Provisions related to Right of Religion:</em></strong></p> <p>Article 9 of the South African Constitution ensures equality to the citizens with no discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs. Article 31 of the same Constitution gives the Right of practising one’s culture to any religious or religious community. Moreover, Article 15, enshrined in the Bill of Rights, ensures religious observances in public institutions and facilities, provided that the rules are followed in accordance with the authorities.</p> <p>The Constitution of South Africa accommodates the interests of all religions and thus holds true to the essence of ‘secularism’. Unlike the French approach to secularism and freedom of religious expression wherein the state maintains ‘neutrality’ by not getting engaged in the matters of religion, the South African approach recognises the fundamental rights of an individual by incorporating rights associated with religious freedom within the ambit of state affairs. The concept of religious observation enclosed within the national boundaries might seem not so ‘uniform’ to a country that follows the French approach. Nevertheless, in reality, the South African model owing to its high significance and pragmatic approach, is practised vividly in countries such as India and Canada. These countries allow people to express religious symbols in both public as well as private spheres, without any restrictions imposed by inhumane laws.</p> <h3>C. Secular State: India<br>(Partial Separation between State and Religion)</h3> <p></p> <p><strong><em>Constitutional Provisions relating to Right of Religion (source the Constitution of India):</em></strong><br></p> <ul> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 25</span>: Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 26</span>: Freedom to manage religious affairs.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 27</span>: Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 28</span>: Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions.</li> </ul> <p>After the formation of two different countries post-independence in 1947, India came to be known as a secular state safeguarding religious and cultural rights to each individual regardless of their personal belief. The state thus intervenes in matters related to religious affair and helps in the formulation of various religion-based laws for various socio-political reasons. Justice K. Ramaswamy by stating that “secularism is, therefore, part of the fundamental law and basic structure of the Indian political system to secure to all its people socio-economic needs essential for man’s excellence with material and moral prosperity and political justice,” very well articulates the root foundations of this very secular diverse state (Singh 599). The laws and legislations allow the people to wear religious attires and symbols in both the private and public sphere, not restricting it to certain preferred surroundings or closed spaces. People across the Indian territory wear burqas, niqabs, turbans, sarees, and many other religious symbols. And if one gets discriminated against or harassed for practicing their expression of religion, they can knock on the doors of the court for an infringement of their personal right. India, owing to its multicultural society, thus, tries to accommodate the rights of all its citizen. And inherently provides with adequate legislation for the ones who have somehow faced the brunt of religious discrimination or intolerance. The Indian approach to the principle of ‘secularism’ differs from the French approach of ‘secularism’ (based on laïcité principle) as the Indian model advocates for the doctrines of inclusivity (based on religious communities) and humanity. While France prides itself aligning with the principles of ‘secularism’, it is India (and many other countries who recognize the Right to Freedom of Religion and Expression) which truly stands as a secular state in its entirety. Furthermore, the South African approach to secularism was drafted on the same lines as the Indian one, as they both stand for the Right to freedom of religious expression (clothing in this case). With the rise of modernity and liberalism, people possess the will to carry out anything with their desire, and not even the national laws can curtail one’s human rights in its claws.</p> <p>However, there have been several challenges to the idea of secularism within the country. One of the main challenges to secularism in India is religious and communal politics, which stems from conflict in interest. Since the 1980s, we have seen the rise in formation of the various religion-based organizations, such as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Shiv Sena and All Indian Muslim League, who use their power to gain political mileage and thus influence the masses in creating a divide between the different religious communities (Singh 603). While it looks like such organizations may be secular in theory but on the contrary, many of them possess a radical approach in handling handle affairs related to religious interests. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) reports of 2016 and 2018, the practice of anti-conversion laws (Mathur) (in different states) are significantly used to “create a hostile, and on occasion violent, environment for religious minority communities” as they are misused to create communal differences among the people (Love-Jihad law recently passed in Uttar Pradesh is one such law used inappropriately in many cases). Although the Constitution of India was formulated keeping in the ideas of secularism, freedom to religion and democracy in the 1940s, it has now started to sweep away from its roots lately.</p> <p>With the growing communal indifferences in the recent years, Rakesh Bajrangi, a Bajrang Dal leader, proposed the ban of pheran in the Kashmir valley while claiming that clothing helps the militant carry firearms. In 2014, Kashmiri journalists were forbidden from wearing this cultural attire at different events held by these occupational forces. However, it was soon scrapped off due to the enormous criticism it brought upon itself. Moreover, Satya Pal Malik, the Governor of J&K in 2018, banned people from wearing pheran at a few of its offices (Malik). The practice to ban a piece of clothing is submissively present in the Indian territories as well. While the government fails to recognize the importance of a cultural attire in the lives of ordinary people, it also infringes the Right to freedom of cultural and religious expression, guaranteed to its citizen with the help of the Constitution. It is therefore necessary for the people ‘sitting in power’ to not use its impressionable citizens for their own political gain. And it is equally important for the citizens of India to reinvent the foundational principles of its native territory and respect the rich cultural diversity of various communities residing in the same ecosystem.</p> <h2>I. Countries whose legal system is not enshrined with the doctrine of 'secularism'</h2> <h3>A. Theocratic State: Saudi Arabia<br>(No separation between the state and religion)</h3> <p>The Basic Law of Governance (1992) of Saudi Arabia states Islam as the official religion of the state, and the Constitution is thus drafted according to the principles and teachings of the Quran. The legal system is formulated on the basis of the sharia law (Interpreted as per the Hanbali School of Sunni Islamic Jurisprudence) and therefore does not recognize any religion other than Islam (Doumato 568). Freedom of religion is prohibited, and the citizens are not allowed to practice or profess their religions in public spheres. Although it allows people to practice their faith within the boundaries of their domestic spheres, it fails to comply with the fact that religious practices (other than that of Islam) are not limited to restricted spaces. Moreover, the law criminalises “the promotion of atheistic ideologies in any form” and “any attempt to cast doubt on the fundamentals of Islam,” or publications that “contradict the provisions of Islamic law” (International Religious Freedom Report 2020). And thus, condemns the display of non-Islamic symbols and other acts involving religious worship.</p> <p> In theocratic countries like Saudi Arabia, the state is closely linked to matters of religious affairs (unlike the French approach mentioned in the above section) and are responsible for drafting laws as per their conservative beliefs. While one country is forcing women to wear niqabs and abayas to preserve Islamic ideologies (Saudi Arabia), the other is proposing laws to ban such religious attires from public places (France). What these both countries inculcate in commonality are the forced measures undertaken to deny the Right to freedom of expression of religion and culture. It is crucial to notice that though France constitutes itself as a “secular” state imbibing the principles of equality, it is, in this case, stepping on the path laid down by a theocratic state like Saudi Arabia. Both countries disregard the true essence of democracy and secularism, for they are very much radical in understanding jurisprudence.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>With the discourse of the paper, we have tried to discuss the persistence of laws infringing or guaranteeing the Right to Freedom of Religious as well as cultural expression. We realise that due to the increasing awareness of human rights and the formation of secular-democratic countries, the way forward would therefore be propounded on the principle of inclusivity. It is thus fair to say that it is time that France should terminate the age-old laïcité principle involving secularism and try to switch towards the nuances of modernity. While it may seem like an impressionable mind would get influenced by a certain religion due to the religious freedom of another’s expression, such apprehension is not true in its entirety. The display of symbols and attires of different religious faiths inculcate the element of togetherness amongst people. It also helps us to accept people for whom they are meaningful, making us tolerant towards the citizens living in a society. </p>{% endblock editorialpost %}''')

In this article we will shed some light on the challenges that the OBC reservations have had to face through judgements of courts and more importantly answer: whether the demand of Jats and Marathas to be enlisted as OBCs was/is a constitutionally sound demand or not as per the interpretations of the court?</p> <h2 id="sec-introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Reservation is an old tradition in India, and it is not uncommon to see society divided based on caste. Its origin can be traced back to ancient times when the practice of 'untouchability,' the caste system, and the Varna system was prevalent. In the descending order of their social hierarchy, Hindu society was divided into Varna or classes: Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Shudras. In addition, there was another class of people known as "untouchables" or "Avarna," which means "without class." These untouchables were deemed unfit for society and were therefore removed from the social system. They were forced to live outside of the village and had no social rights. The legal component of reservation in India dates back to 1919 when the Government of India Act was enacted. This legislation addressed various minorities' difficulties, including establishing communal electorates, and Montague-Chelmsford criticized it because he feared it would impede India's self-development. After 1919, the Simon Commission was formed in 1927, in which seats were reserved for the underprivileged, and there was a need for a broader franchise since the poor's economic, educational, and social circumstances did not allow them to vote appropriately. In 1931, a Round Table Conference was held in London to examine the changes suggested by the Simon Commission. Mahatma Gandhi and Congress strongly opposed these changes, which resulted in the unsolved issue of the minority in the conference. </p> <h2 id="sec-post-independence-scenario">Post-Independence Scenario</h2> <p>The situation changed after independence, and the reservation strategy acquired even more excellent traction. When our own Constitution was drafted, the framers included a special provision to provide equal opportunity in public employment to all Indian citizens. The same provision was included in Article 16 of the Indian Constitution. However, to protect the underprivileged, a specific provision was placed in the same Art. Clause 4 (Art. 16) (4). This clause authorizes the state to make special provisions for those backward classes that, in the state's opinion, are not effectively represented in the state's service. Consequently, Mandal commission was set up, and was responsible for implementing OBC reservations. In 1979, the Janata Government, led by Prime Minister Sri Morarji Desai, established the second Backward Classes Commission, chaired by Sri B.P. Mandal, under Article 340 of the Constitution to investigate the socially and educationally backward classes within India’s territory and suggest initiatives to be taken for their progress, including the essential provisions that must be made for them for the upliftment of their status via equal opportunity in public employment. </p> <p>The panel issued its report in 1980, identifying around 3743 castes as socially and educationally backward groups and recommending a 27% quota in government positions. It was not implemented at the time, but Prime Minister V.P. Singh issued an office memorandum in 1990, reserving 27% of seats for the socially and economically backward groups. For three months, this reservation generated massive chaos among Indian citizens. A writ petition was filed in front of the Supreme Court, challenging the validity of the Government's office of memorandum. The matter was referred to a 9-judge bench known for its landmark decision of Indra Sawney v Union of India in 1992. They questioned the reservation standards, including whether caste alone may form a class or if economic criteria alone are sufficient to identify backwardness. They analyzed various factors and found that financial measures alone are insufficient to determine a class's backwardness. To safeguard the citizen rights, they devised the notion of a creamy and non-creamy layer and a 50% threshold on the reservation. </p> <h2 id="sec-background-of-jats-and-marathas-reservation-case-2014">Background of <em>Jats</em> and <em>Marathas</em> reservation case 2014</h2> <h3 id="sec-maratha-reservation">Maratha Reservation</h3> <p>The State of Maharashtra adopted an ordinance on July 9, 2014, allowing the Maratha to group a 16 per cent quota in education and public jobs. An interim order was granted to postpone the legislation's execution. Following that, Maharashtra implemented the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2014, resulting in a 16% quota for educationally and socially backward classes, including the Maratha community. The Maharashtra state government established the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission in January 2017. The Commission, led by Justice Gaikwad, proposed a 12 per cent and 13 per cent quota for Marathas in educational institutions and public sector employment, respectively, which were implemented in 2018. The act was challenged in front of the Bombay High Court because it was allegedly unconstitutional. The demand for reservation was motivated by an upsurge in the incidence of suicides among Maratha families due to indebtedness and declining incomes. The Bombay High Court confirmed the constitutional legality of the statute in 2019 because the state has the authority to increase the quota. On July 12, 2019, the Supreme Court admitted an appeal against the verdict of the Bombay High Court and issued a notice to the Maharashtra state government. However, it opted not to stay the Bombay High Court's decision. The case was referred to a bigger bench. The decision, in this case, was declared lately on May 5, 2021, and the court decided not to grant reservations since it exceeded the 50% reservation cap . </p> <h3 id="sec-jat-reservation">Jat Reservation</h3> <p>The Jat group is a north Indian martial and farming community that is not historically seen as "backward." For decades, Jats have demanded reservation in Central and State Government Jobs. The UPA government issued a notification incorporating the Jat group on the Central OBC list. Still, the Supreme Court overturned it in 2014, arguing that caste cannot be the only reason for reservation. The Haryana government promised the Jats a special backward class quota based on economic status, but it was a non-negotiable arrangement for the Jats; therefore, they turned it down. The court held that if Haryana added a Jat quota to the current OBC (27%) + scheduled castes & scheduled tribes (22.5%), it would violate the Supreme Court's cap of 50 per cent reservations due to which they were denied reservation in the central OBC list. </p> <p>A similar thread in both cases was that they both cited Article 15 of the Indian Constitution and presented their justification for reservation, which revolved mainly on their inability to obtain suitable employment or education. Whether it is because of caste or because of their precarious financial situation. Another thing that was similar in both circumstances was that their demand for reservations exceeded the 50% limitation, which was ruled in the landmark 1992 case of <strong>Indira Sawney v Union of India</strong>. Hence, the principal reason for refusing their reservation request exceeded the 50 per cent threshold in both situations. Another scenario was for people to comprehend what a backward class is and who is deemed backwards. The National Commission for Backward Classes defines OBC as educationally, socially, and economically backwards, implying that other castes should regard the caste as socially backwards. Educationally, the caste's non-enrollment in schools should be at least 25% higher than the state average, and economically, the typical caste family's assets should be at least 25% lower than the state average. </p> <h2 id="sec-why-obc-reservation-is-controversial">Why OBC reservation is controversial</h2> <p>Over 32.6 million Jats dwell in India, with Haryana accounting for around 29 per cent of all Jats. When the Supreme Court rejected Jats' petition to be included on the central OBC list in 2014, its judgment stated that Jats make up 29 per cent of Haryana's population. They are politically and economically prosperous. They are also better off in terms of education. The demand to be classified as OBC will help them secure the 27 per cent OBC reservation in government employment. However, according to the Supreme Court, "social backwardness" is the fundamental factor in determining backwardness; caste alone cannot be used to justify reservation. </p> <p>Jats were one of India's thirty-six royal races in ancient times. In Indian history, Jats from Himachal Pradesh were considered equal to Kshatriyas, whereas Jats from Rajasthan were deemed equivalent to Rajput’s. Their children received higher education in a variety of fields. During contemporary India, the British admired the Jats for their agricultural and military skills. Whether in ancient times or now, it is apparent that the Jats possessed the resources, talent, and means to be socially and economically stable. They never had to confront what other castes, like SC and ST, have had undergone in the past or present. Because they are well-off, the majority of the OBC does not require reservations. According to a 2019 International Monetary Fund research, OBC has the fastest intergenerational mobility of any community, even upper castes. They are landlords with a variety of properties and a decent education and job opportunities. Many politicians fall within the OBC group as well. Certain OBC indeed requires a reservation, which is why the notion of the creamy-non-creamy layer was introduced, but it is apparent that it is quickly taken advantage of. In a country like the Republic of India, the administration is riddled with its own inconsistencies. It is not difficult to forge fake documents and prove that one belongs to the non-creamy OBC group. The fact that OBC is given reservations based only on their caste and not on their actual need makes OBC reservations controversial. </p> <h2 id="sec-conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Reservation has long been a controversial topic. Reservation is founded on the concept of equitable representation, and it is used as a tactic or as a compensatory exercise to combat prejudice and exploitation caused by caste discrimination, and caste hate against the SC, ST, and OBC's. Reservation has long been a controversial topic. So, to compensate for and overcome the historical denying castes' disadvantages and provide a barrier against caste exploitation, it was decided that the solution must be created solely based on caste and not economy. Reservation was formerly a fundamental right, but the Supreme Court ruled in <strong>Mukesh Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand</strong> that the right to reservation is no longer a fundamental right. It stated that a state has to take certain steps, including research and study, before introducing a reservation but none such studies have to be conducted before scraping them. Giving fundamental rights for reservation is the same as impeding the nation's development, advancement, and efficiency from all perspectives. </p> <p>On one hand, our Constitution states that we are a free and sovereign country. On the other hand, the reservation framework enslaves all of these perspectives, causing dissimilarity and differences among individuals. Reservation is vital to some extent. However, some unnecessarily demand reservation even if they are adequately represented. The most vulnerable classes within the protected sections are unaware of how to benefit from the provision or even that such provisions exist. It is not fair to provide reservation to someone who lives the same life as a general, or maybe a better one. If the reservation policy continues in this manner, it will eventually become a discriminatory procedure. Every year, the policy should be evaluated, and a poll should be done to see whether the most vulnerable among the “backward” are receiving benefits. There is a great need for mental change, for which awareness and education are critical, and it is only through education that fundamental human ideals can be instilled. In addition, well-off backward groups must step out and declare that they are self-sufficient and capable enough to require reservations no longer. </p> <hr> <h3 id="sec-references"><em>References</em></h3> <ol> <li id="ref1">Item 1</li> <li id="ref2">List Item</li> <li id="ref3">List Item</li> <li id="ref4">List Item</li> </ol> {% endblock editorialpost %}''')
    editorial2 = Editorial(public_id = str(uuid.uuid4()), title = "Separation of Powers", sub_title="Overlapping powers of Executive and Legislative", toc="Abstract,Introduction,Separation of Powers,Overlapping of Powers,Pros and Cons of the Overlap,Conclusion,References", keywords="", user_id=3, content='''{% extends "editorialpost.html" %}{% block editorialpost %}<h2 id="sec-abstract">Abstract</h2> <p>Indian Constitution recognizes separation of powers and divides the State into three integral branches, which are, Executive, Legislative and Judiciary. These three branches are further individually divided into more sub-categories. The main three branches have horizontal power sharing, they are of equal stature and supposedly share equal powers even though each has separate functions to perform, and within the branches the power sharing is vertical, where power decreases as you go down the levels. A great example of vertical power sharing is the power difference between the Supreme Court (the apex court) and the district courts though both are part of Judiciary but don’t share equal powers. The functions and obligations of each branch is specified however there are times when the powers overlap, in a vertical power sharing system overlapping is not an issue as the more powerful one gets to decide in the end but in a horizontal power sharing system this becomes a concern. In this article we will look at the decisions of courts regarding such overlap of powers between Executive and Legislative, furthermore discuss the Pros and Cons of having such overlaps.</p> <h2 id="sec-introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>The Indian Constitution was adopted by the constituent assembly on January 26, 1947, and came into effect on November 26, 1950, however the parliamentary system existed since 1927 and was allowed to continue in the newly made Constitution of India. The Indian Constitution has several unique elements that set it apart from other international constitutions. It is the longest Constitution; it is thorough because it deals with the complicated and diversified circumstances that existed (and still exists) at the time of its formulation and adoption after the British granted India independence. A federal parliamentary system of Government with well-defined and demarcated duties for the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary was established because one organ cannot conduct all functions in a coordinated and sufficient manner. The core of parliamentary Government is the head of state, who also serves as the constitutional head. However, the true executive powers are vested in the Council of Ministers, led by the Prime Minister, who takes executive action on behalf of the head of state (the President of India) and is India's first organ. The legislative, which consists of the President, the Parliament (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha), and the state legislatures, is India's second institution. The Judiciary is the third organ, and its provisions are included in Chapters IV and VI of the Constitution. In India, the Constitution, not the Parliament, is supreme, as it is in England. In that sense, the Indian Parliament is not a sovereign body because it derives all of its powers from the Constitution. The Indian Constitution establishes a clear division between India's three organs. The allocation of the Government's political, administrative, and judicial responsibilities is referred to as the separation of powers. It reduces the possibility of unlawful governmental activities since the implementation, compliance, and execution of laws must be sanctioned by all three branches. To comprehend whether or not legislative and executive powers overlap, one must first grasp how they vary from one another. </p> <h2 id="sec-separation-of-power">Separation of Power</h2> <p>Charles-Louis de Secondat, baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, an 18th century French social and political philosopher, invented the phrase "trias politica" or "separation of powers." Thus, separation of powers refers to the division of government duties into different segments to prevent anyone department from performing the fundamental activities. The objective is to minimize power concentration and to create checks and balances. Although the Indian Constitution does not strictly provide for the separation of powers, some articles offer general guidance on how the powers are separated; however, these articles are mainly applicable to the separation of powers for the Judiciary from the Executive and legislative branches. Article 50[i]<a href="#ref1">1</a> specifies that the State or Government concerned would take reasonable efforts to guarantee that the judicial branch is distinct from the functioning and operation of the executive branch. According to Article 361[vi]<a href="#ref2">2</a>, the President or any governor of any state is not answerable to any court in the country for acts and activities conducted in performance/exercise of their powers and responsibilities. Both articles separated the Judiciary from the Executive </p> <p>In contrast, Articles 121[ii]<a href="#ref3">3</a> and 211[iii]<a href="#ref4">4</a> states that the administration of justice or how a judge discharges his duties of any Court cannot be discussed in the Legislature. Articles 122[iv]<a href="#ref5">5</a> and 212[v]<a href="#ref6">6</a> deprive the Judiciary of any power to review and question the validity of proceedings in a legislature or the Parliament, separating the Judiciary from legislative. However, there is no clear separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches. </p> <h2 id="sec-overlapping-of-powers">Overlapping of Powers</h2> <p>While separation of powers is essential to the functioning of the Indian Government, no democratic system exists with a complete separation of powers or, for that matter, a complete lack of separation of powers. Governmental authorities and duties are purposefully overlapping; they are too complicated and interconnected to be cleanly segregated. As a result, there is some level of competition and conflict among the organs of Government. Every organ's actual functioning overlap with the other two organs of Government in specific ways. This overlapping allows the organs to function as a check on each other without interfering too much. For example, According to Article 142[vii]<a href="#ref7">7</a>, the Supreme Court acts as an Executive to achieve complete justice. The Judiciary can also evaluate executive action to see if it breaches the Constitution. That is how the Judiciary interfere with the Executive and legislative branches when required. The Executive appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges. This demonstrates further overlapping, as the Executive may impact the functioning of the Judiciary in this way. Ordinarily, the Legislature has complete legislative authority, but the President may be authorized to exercise legislative authority under specific circumstances. For example, while the Parliament is not in session, the President may enact an ordinance under Article 123<a href="#ref8">8</a>, establishing the regulations in an emergency. Apart from overlapping powers between the Executive and Judiciary, the Indian systems also lack personnel separation between these departments. The council of ministers, for example, is a component of both the Executive and the Legislature. Another case in point is when a cabinet minister performs both executive and administrative duties. According to Article 74(1)<a href="#ref9">9</a>, the executive head is required to follow the recommendations of the cabinet ministers. The Supreme Court ruled in Ram Jawaya vs State of Punjab<a href="#ref10">10</a> that the Executive is a part of the legislative and must answer it. The three integral organs are interconnected, since India is a Parliamentary democracy. Although India does not have a rigid separation of powers like the American Constitution, a check and balance system is in place. However, no organs are to take over the fundamental activities of other organs that are part of the basic structure, even if altered. If amended, such change would be considered unconstitutional.</p> <h2 id="sec-pros-and-cons-of-the-overlap">Pros and Cons of the Overlap</h2> <p>The public's trust in the institutions of Government is critical in such a sophisticated and dynamic democracy. People's confidence in the organs' quality, efficiency, and integrity is eroded due to their recurrent intrusions into other organ's decisions. It weakens the spirit of democracy because the concentration of power in government institutions undermines the idea of checks and balances. </p> <p>The most significant overlap concern may be that any, one specific organ cannot be held accountable for its action. On the other hand, enabling power-sharing rules improves accountability and equity on the part of the Government. The overlap prohibits arbitrary acts by the other two branches of Government. One example of the same could be the judicial review authority of the Apex Court of India. The delineation of overriding powers in the Constitution reduces the potential of dispute among government organs. Moreover, the overlapping functions promote power-sharing and power decentralization, guaranteeing that the three organs can work together to address problems more quickly. </p> <h2 id="sec-conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Both separation of powers and overlapping powers have advantages and disadvantages. Even if separation of powers cannot be enforced strictly in any modern country such as the United States, Nepal, France, and so on, this theory is still relevant today. Though, some may claim that it slows the system down, it is vital for a constitutional system's smooth and correct operation. This theory is critical because it preserves an individual's liberty against arbitrary control and prevents organs from usurping the vital tasks of other organs. On the other hand, overlapping of powers has its benefits. Our government is a well-organized institution, and it is difficult to segregate it into watertight units. Cooperation and coordination among all three branches of Government are required for the successful running of any government. A Parliamentary system with a strict separation of powers is unnecessary and unsustainable for a democratic country with a diverse population like India. Nonetheless, with judicial and calibrated constitutional functional overlap, the institutional cooperation of the three government organs is feasible. This type of collaboration bridges the legislative, executive, and judicial barriers, allowing the Government to function smoothly.</p> <hr> <h3 id="sec-references"><em>References</em></h3> <ol> <li id="ref1">Item 1</li> <li id="ref2">List Item</li> <li id="ref3">List Item</li> <li id="ref4">List Item</li> <li id="ref5">List Item</li> <li id="ref6">List Item</li> <li id="ref7">List Item</li> <li id="ref8">List Item</li> <li id="ref9">List Item</li> <li id="ref10">List Item</li> </ol>{% endblock editorialpost %}''')
