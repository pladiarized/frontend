After the rule of various coalition governments at the Centre in the early 2000s, it was Bhartiya Janata Party who managed to secure the majority seats establishing their rule over the whole territory. Their trajectory to conquer state ship has been solely based on the principle of ‘single-party majority rule, and it is this strategy that overthrew the Congress’s trajectory of alliances based national government. BJP, a national political party walking on the principles laid down by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, endorses its right-wing ideology of Hindutva. They contend for the supremacy of one religion that is Hinduism, over the other counterparts, such as Islam, Christianity, and Sikhism. There have also been several reports of atrocities being committed against minorities under the BJP rule since the tenure of 2014. Such rule governed by the principle of communalism speaks volumes of the inhumane, theocratic ideals possessed by this political party and its leaders. While worldwide, India is known for its secular principles of ‘unity in diversity,’ but in reality, the religious or caste minorities are to this date suffering under the BJP led right-wing agenda. Further, we aim to list out the various ways and instances of communalism being inflicted in the territory by the Modi-led government.</p> <p>One of the ways integral to the forces of Hindutva has been the establishment of autonomy over the educational as well as the cultural institutions. At first, they begin to plot their loyalists in positions or posts of control and administration at these very institutions. By appointing their own people, they can easily make decisions on their behalf, inflicting their selfish strategies. One of the strategies involves the curtailments on the curriculum being administered within such institutions. This methodology provokes a sense of belonging to the ‘supreme’ community at elementary stages with the help of the school curriculum. Like in the state of Haryana (BJP led government), it had recently incorporated chapters from the Bhagavata Gita (Holy book in Hindu mythology). Moreover, the state of Gujrat introduced nine books, propagating right-wing ideologies in 42,000 schools across the state. Written by Dina Nath Batra, an RSS leader, his ‘secular’ book entails a foreword by Modi himself, who describes it as an inspiration for the younger generations. In Madhya Pradesh, the practice of a specific yoga asana, <em>Surya namaskar</em> (a practice introduced in Hindu mythology), has been made compulsory in the curriculum of government schools. There have also been talks for a change in the National Education policy for states across India, wherein most of its recommendations have been kept confidential for the public sphere as of yet.<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></sup> Such nuances of getting a hold on the curriculum of educational institutes enforce one’s religious beliefs on the other, with a complete mindset of brainwashing the young, innocent children. It is not only violative of an individual’s fundamental rights but also encourages intolerance towards the fellow citizens of our democratic homeland.</p> <p>Despite the presence of the freedom to practice and propagate any religion (by the Constitution), there have been restrictions involving forced conversion, which is valid per se, but it also incorporates the element of conversion done by ‘fraud’ or ‘allurement.’ These two terms are highly vague and provide a ground for arguments and allegations on charitable, educational institutes, such as the Christians who operate in Dalit areas<sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></sup>; this practice involves a form of ‘fraud’ and thus are termed illegal. The broader context of delimiting such church-run networks is the constant threat they possess to the communal forces in power. These institutions not just provide employment to people regardless of their religious communities but only inculcate a conscience for serving the unprivileged and the undermined. Bringing about the conscience for humanity serves as a secularizing force among the masses and hence stands as an obstacle in front of the right-wing agenda.</p> <p>Furthermore, the current dynamic surrounding the ‘Love-jihad’ situation is upsetting as several people who are just merely in love are wronged at the hands of communal forces, which give the institute of marriage (an intimate relationship) rather than a communal angle, where in most cases it is not. Such gross practices are conducted in order to humiliate other minority religious communities such as the Muslims. The popular contention of Muslim men almost ‘kidnaping’ their Hindu brides, thus forcing them to marriage, is just a false narrative construed to prevent religious conversions of the Hindu population. For they wish to maintain the purity resonated by the religion of Hinduism, as all other non-Hindu religions are just a form of ‘impurity’ in their terms.<sup><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></sup> Currently, seven states in India entail anti-conversion laws, requiring an individual to seek permission for the conversion beforehand. States such as Uttar Pradesh in North India, a BJP state government, have seen numerous cases concerning the matters of ‘love jihad’ in recent months.</p> <p>According to Hindu beliefs, the cow is regarded as a symbol of worship and motherhood. And in the process of safeguarding their ‘mother,’ there has been deliberation over a national ban on cow slaughter all over the Indian territory. While it is already banned in several states, such as Uttar Pradesh (BJP led government), it continues to be a matter of utmost importance for the political party ignoring issues that require immediate attention at hand. In the recent past, several atrocities have been committed against Muslims (for they consume beef) on just the mere speculation of beef consumption. Like in the Dadri village case, Mohammed Akhlaq was brutally killed by a Hindu mob, for there was a probability that he possessed beef in his personal capacity at his home. Taking the life of an individual on the mere pretext of beef consumption showcases the backwardness of people living in ‘modern’ India.  Using violent measures to prevent individuals from consuming a certain kind of meat throws light upon the persistence of communal violence between religious communities. The Dadri case brought widespread criticism on an international level, highlighting the failure of the government at handling mob-lynching cases. In several cases, even fuelling the instances of mob-lynching to harass minorities while upholding the ideals of ‘Hindutva.’</p> <p><strong>The Ayodhya Case of Communal Conflict</strong></p> <p>One of the huge reasons that led to the tremendous growth of the NDA-led government in the late twentieth century was due to case of Babri Masjid. With the mass mobilisation in the hands of the Sangh, they were able to pursue the masses into the demolition of a religious place of worship, which inherently goes against the laws of the Indian Constitution. Since such an act advocated for the birthplace of a Hindu God (Ram Janmabhoomi) and the religious beliefs of Hindus, it produced grave communal tensions between the two communities- Hindus and Muslims. This tactical strategy to evoke the essence of religious nationalism helped them garner a popular majoritarian vote of the Hindus. Along the same lines, resonating with the idea of a Hindu state (Hindutva), it also undermined the rights of the inferior religious community (Muslims).</p> <p>While this controversial case was pending with the judiciary for ages, it was only in 2019 that the verdict was given in favour of Hindus.<sup><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></sup> This move was again enacted in accordance with their party politics of ‘Hindu supremacy’ in an attempt to create a rift between religious communities and enact their policy of ‘divide and rule.’ However, this time, they did not quite succeed in their attempt as the opposition (Muslims) were fairly silent on the communal conflict of the judgment. It is fair to say that such instances involving communism successfully hide the greater matters of concern revolving around nation development, which then conceals the shortcomings of the government at the Centre. Thus, it is important to create a conflict of interests, for the political parties can then govern the citizens of the country using their selfish, archaic means.</p> <p><strong>The issue of Kashmir: Abrogation of Article 370</strong></p> <p> Spun between the party politics of several governments, Kashmir is one sight that accounts for the conflicting interests of different countries like India, China, and Pakistan. Although the reason attributed to the abrogation of Article 370 by the BJP government was stated to ‘restore’ the integration of Kashmiris with the rest of India and to minimise the growth of militancy and terrorism in the valley, it tends to inculcate a more viable hidden ‘Hindutva’ agenda (on lines with the RSS and the BJP).<sup><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></sup> By unprecedently diminishing the special provisions granted to the Muslim majority state (Kashmir) at the time of the Independence, it can, in fact, help with the ideological position of establishing a Hindu Rashtra wherein the identity of religious minorities is considerably abated. This is another means of disintegrating the identity of the local inhabitants of the Kashmir valley, striving for communal tension with the rest of India. Apart from shouting slogans of integration, India should instead be empathetic towards the needs of this military-occupied territory, who have constantly been denied their democratic rights since the beginning of time.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Throughout, we analyse the different uprisings of communal conflict and tension in the past decade. And we have also witnessed the extent of damage and despair it has caused to human civilisation. The worse part is that with every other day, such inhumane acts or atrocities are increasing tremendously. While the political scenarios play a massive factor in the mishap, it is the people who give in to such notions reluctantly without realising the demoralising values such acts impart.</p> <p>The way forward holding on to the principles and ideals of modernity requires the complete annihilation of the persistent communal tension between different sects of people in the society. It is significant for people to release that just by fighting for the sanctity of one’s own beliefs and values, we cannot disregard the essence of humanity. Merely acting on behalf of certain political powers, acting as their ‘puppets,’ has never done any good in the history of human existence, and it will not ever do. On a larger note, it is human’s own conscience that sets us apart from such ‘animal-like behaviour.’ Therefore, it is just the people living in an ecosystem(society) who can be a humane change in perspective.</p> <p> </p> <hr> <h6 id="sec-references"><em>References</em></h6> <ul> <li><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Vanaik, Achin. <em>The Rise of Hindu Authoritarianism: Secular Claims, Communal Realities</em>. 1st edition, Verso, 2017.</li> <li><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Ibid</li> <li><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Ibid</li> <li><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Mahaprashasta, Ajoy Ashirwad. “Ayodhya Dispute Is a Battle Between Faith and Rationality, Says Historian D.N.
